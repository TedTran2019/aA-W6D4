jQuery Triggering: Can trigger events manually instead of when the user
takes some action

Event Propagation -> Bubbles onto its parents in nesting order, e.g inner ->
middle -> outer

event.target -> deepest element which triggered the event
event.currentTarget -> element on which the handler is registered

Can stop propagation through event.stopPropagation(), meaning no more bubbling!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

History -> web api that allows browser session history manipulation
- session history is stack of URLs user has visited within a given tab
- can access thru window.history in client-side JS
- methods: #back(), #forward(), etc
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History

Location -> web api to access/manipulate current URL
- window.location
- useful properties:
	- href -> string containing entire href, can set to another url to make GET
		request and navigate
	- hash, returns a string containing # followed by fragment identifier
	- setting hash to any string will append fragment identifier to the URL and not
		make another GET request
- notice that location changes pushes to the History obj
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location

Altering window.location.hash fires a special hashchange event -> can add
handler/trigger callback whenever hash changes
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Vanilla JS -> means using a language/library w/o additional enhancements,
e.g vanilla JS -> JS without any additional libraries

jQuery with Rails bc of jquery-rails gem, makes things easy.
jquery-ujs monkey-patches AJAX requests to include Rails CSRF token

Exs. of when cannot use jQuery
1. jQuery is a considerably sized resource, if need speed, may want to use API
	provided by browser instead
2. Not needed for basic DOM manipulation, will suffice without jQuery
3. Company that pays you doesn't like it, boom!

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model
3 main classes:
1. Node -> basic element representing a node on the Dom
2. Element -> Inherits from node, each ele on doc is a descendent of Element
	a. HTMLElement -> inherits from Element, specifically represents HTML elements
		(created from HTML tags)
	b. HTMLCollection -> array-like obj containing collection of HTMlElement
3. Document -> root element of page, serves as entry point to the content in
	our page

To select something from page -> call method on document that would return either
an HTMLElement or HTMLCollection

Basic methods:
- document.getElementById
- Element.getElementsByClassName
- Element.querySelectorAll
- EventTarget.addEventListener
- Node.appendChild
- Node.removeChild

It looks like it'll be the same game as jQuery-- just constantly looking at the
docs for methods/learning what it takes/returns/does.

Why does Rails like $.ajax wrapper instead of plain XMLHttpRequest?
- jQuery w/ those two gems mentioned earlier will automatically handle CSRF tokens
- jQuery will automatically transform JSON (string) into JS objs.
- jQuery API much more user-friendly than XHR
https://assets.aaonline.io/fullstack/javascript/demos/vanilla_user_search.js
- Notice setting inner HTML to '' is equiv. to removing all child elements
- notice methods used

Functionality of AJAX accomplished thru XMLHttpRequest obj aka XHR. Steps to
make this are
1. Create a XHR obj
2. Tell it where to go and what verb to use
3. Tell it what to do when it's finished loading (register a callback)
4. Send off the request (w/ optional data)
new XMLHttpRequest(), #open, #onload, #send, #status, #responseType, #response, etc
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest

What is the delegateTarget -> where event handler was attached
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Brendan Eich -> created JS in 10 days in 1995, under Netscape Communications
w/ collaboration of Sun Microsystems.
Following suit, Microsoft made JScript in IE 3.0 -> 1997, ECMAScript was made
as a standard.
Javascript, JScript, and ActionScript are all valid implementations of ECMAScript
- Microsoft's IE is only browser that uses Jscript
- ActionScript more OOP than JS, uses classical inheritance rather than prototypical.
	Developed by Macromedia Inc, merged into Adobe, rapidly declined since Apple/Adobe
	Flash controversy

Package managers: NPM vs Bower
- handles project dependencies
- Bower esp. for managing frontend dependencies, so bundling tool like Webpack
	is not required
- aA uses npm w/ webpack

Vocab:
vanilla: standard JS w/o frameworks/libraries
hoisting: var/function declarations put into memory at compile time, can call
	declared func/var before it's defined
'use strict'; -> on top of JS files, special compiler directive called pragma.
Ensures code in scope follows certain rules
IIFE -> immediately invoked function expression, called immediately after defined
jQuery -> free open source JS library to manipulate DOM
	- jQuery's utility functions roughly mirror those provided by lodash.js.
MEAN stack -> MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node
	a. MongoDB - noSQL db
	b. Express - Sinatra-inspired server
	c. Angular - frontend MVC framework
	d. Node - server-side JS environment

Functional Programming -> JS w/ treatment of functions as first-class objs, can
be treated as a functional lang w/o much effort. Redux uses several patterns/concepts
from functional programming such as currying, pure functions, and no mutation of
information. These ideas can encompass entirety of JS program thru use of various
libraries.
- Immutable.js -> makes every obj immutable, to update an obj's info, replace with
	a new object

POJO -> plain old javascript object. OBj w/ attributes, setter methods, getter methods.
Any JS obj w/o additional methods is a POJO.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Browsers
- purpose to display web resources
- user of browser tells it where resource is located
- browser fetches, parses, and displays that resource

Main components:
- UI -> consist of browser display elements
- browser engine: coordinates UI and rendering engine
- rendering enguine: displays requested content, parsing HTML/CSS if necessary
- networking: handles network calls
- UI backend: draws widgets like dropdown lists and windows
- Javascript interpreter
- Data storage: handles cookies and localStorage, etc.
Browsers are made of millions of lines of C++ code...
- Typically a browser will have instance of rendering enguine running for each tab
- Diff browsers use diff rendering engines, in general their pattern is
	- parse HTML doc to construct DOM tree
		- HTML eles get converted to DOM nodes in content tree
	- construct render tree
		- CSS info/styling from HTML to create render tree from content tree
		- rectangle for each node w/ dimension in color, ordered in same way as
			ordered on display
	- add layout info to render tree
		- each node receives exact coors on screen
	- paint the render tree
		- render tree is traversed and each node painted, uses UI backend to access
			OS drawing capabilities

HTML Parsing, 2 things need to happen
1. HTML doc broken into HTML elements
2. rules of HTML syntax applied to elements
Not a context-free grammar, so parsing is complex.
JS can be loaded syn or async, while stylesheets are always sync.

Render Tree Construction:
- Each ele in render tree called a frame or a renderer knows how to layout/paint
	itself and is children
- Width/height/position, rectangular area
- Floating/absolutely positioned handled diff from block/inline
- Computing style of a given element can be very costly -- to optimize, some browsers
	use two extra trees. Style-context and rule. If this isn't implemented, imagine
	4x traversal for style declarations....
- hashmap is used to filter out rules that don't apply to a given element.
	- selected then ordered by specificity

Layout:
- HTML uses a flow-based layout model, can start at 0,0 and find pos of almost all
	elements in a single pass.
- Progresses recursively from html to all descendants
- 2 events can trigger layout events: global changes and incremental changes
- global layout sync, incremental layout async

Painting: Order is
Background color -> background image -> border -> children -> outline
Can be global or incremental, little work as possible in respond to a change...
Both at structural and at a lower level...

How browsers work!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Code wrapped in event listener for 'DOMContentLoaded'! Same as jQuery's
$() wrapping!

querySelector -> returns single element, first found
querySelectorAll -> returns all elements wrapped in a NodeList obj

#createElement, #textContent, #appendChild, access attributes thru dot notation,
#removeChild, #parentElement, #value getter/setter, #addEventListener
- Notice the etc.parentElement.removeChild(etc)
- can do etc.disabled = true to disable and such

HTML5 added classList, which has #add, #remove, #contains, #toggle

Phase 1: Implementing #empty, #remove, #attr, #addClass, #removeClass, #html,
#find, #children, #parent
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/element

Jvascript's built-in #innerHTML

Hmm, notice how you had to use #cloneNode because those children nodes couldn't
be appended to multiple parents/the same parent multiple times.

JS spread operator for array into multiple arguments

Can also use spread operator as it's functionally equiv. to Array.from.
Array.from converts whatever into an array! Could also use
Array.prototype.slice.call(whatever) to make a new array!

Look at how they refrained from adding duplicate parents in the instructor's
solution-- usage of an extra attrib visited.

Use everything at your disposal to solve the problem, even if it seems
hacky at the time!

Huh, how foolish of me. I thought for querySelector and querySelectorAll could
only be used on document obj, not just any type of node to start from there.
Woo, that makes things a lot easier.

remove vs removeChild -> identical results
remove needs ref to child, removeChild needs reference to parent and child

#on and #off only accept one handler, the latest one!
Instructor solution did an extremely basic on/off without most of jQuery
functionality...

#splice proves to be very useful...
2 args -> start, delete count

DOMContentLoaded vs Document.readyState...

"Most browsers provide similar functionality in the form of a DOMContentLoaded
event. However, jQuery's .ready() method differs in an important and useful way:
If the DOM becomes ready and the browser fires DOMContentLoaded before the code
calls .ready( handler ), the function handler will still be executed. In contrast,
a DOMContentLoaded event listener added after the event fires is never executed."
